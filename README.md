# Longest-Compound-Word_
Given a sorted list of words, find the longest compound word in the list that is constructed by concatenating the words in the list. For example, if the input list is: ['cat', 'cats', 'catsdogcats', 'catxdogcatsrat', 'dog', 'dogcatsdog', 'hippopotamuses', 'rat', 'ratcat', 'ratcatdog', 'ratcatdogcat']. Then the longest compound word is 'ratcatdogcat' with 12 letters. Note that the longest individual words are 'catxdogcatsrat' and 'hippopotamuses' with 14 letters, but they're not fully constructed by other words. Former one has an extra 'x' letter, and latter is an individual word by itself not a compound word.

Using Trie, which let words to share prefixes

Let’s illustrate the process with an example, the first word is cat and we add it to the trie. Since it doesn’t have a prefix, we continue. Second word is cats, we add it to the trie and check whether it has a prefix, and yes it does, the word cat. So we append the pair <’cats’, ‘s’> to the queue, which is the current word and the suffix. The third word is catsdogcats, we again insert it to the trie and see that it has 2 prefixes, cat and cats. So we add 2 pairs <’catsdogcats’, ‘sdogcats’> and <’catsdogcats’, ‘dogcats’> where the former suffix correspond to the prefix cat and the latter to cats. We continue like this by adding <’catxdogcatsrat’, ‘xdogcatsrat’> to the queue and so on. And here’s the trie formed by adding example the words in the problem definition:
